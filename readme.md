# PzCompare
> PzCompare, the best way to compare your favorite items!

The item stats are extracted from <https://pzwiki.net> by scraping it via **BeautifulSoup4**, and are parsed by the **api** which will be a public api once all problems are fixed.

## Problems
- Inconsistent item data and names from *PzWiki*.
- Further optimizations needed for the api (it is pretty good for now).
- Frontend needs a little polishing and qol features.
- Updates section (low priority).

### Main
I am still working on this site, I will deploy it in a couple of days after I'm sure it works fine which it does but you know... better to be safe than sorry.
